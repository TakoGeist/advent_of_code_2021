# Rust - Advent of Code 2021

<p>My Advent of Code 2021 solutions in the Rust programming language. This repository contains each day and part as individual files that all run from 
a single master file, as such there's a substantial increase in compilation time.<br>
  I try to develop simple solutions which sometimes sacrifices performance.</p>
  
## Computing solutions
<p>Each day contains a text file in input folder corresponding to the puzzle's input.<br>
  To get the solution simply run the program as such:</p>
  
  ```
  #to run day 1:
  cargo run --release 1
  
  #to run day 10:
  cargo run --release 10
  ```
